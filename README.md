```

### üîß Core Technical Components

**PoseNet Model Architecture:**
- **Backbone Network**: MobileNetV1 for optimal speed/accuracy balance
- **Output Layers**: Two-branch architecture for keypoint heatmaps and offset vectors
- **Post-Processing**: Non-maximum suppression and keypoint scoring
- **Optimization**: Quantized weights for faster inference

**Custom Exercise Algorithms:**
```javascript
// Example: Push-up analysis algorithm
function analyzePushUp(keypoints) {
  const shoulder = keypoints[5];  // Left shoulder
  const elbow = keypoints[7];     // Left elbow
  const wrist = keypoints[9];     // Left wrist
  
  // Calculate elbow angle for form analysis
  const angle = calculateAngle(shoulder, elbow, wrist);
  
  // Check depth based on shoulder-hip relationship
  const depth = calculateDepth(keypoints);
  
  // Assess back straightness
  const backAlignment = checkBackAlignment(keypoints);
  
  return { angle, depth, backAlignment, isValid: angle > 90 && depth > 0.7 };
}
```

**Performance Optimization Strategies:**
- Model quantization for faster inference
- Frame skipping during processing peaks
- Intelligent keypoint smoothing
- Memory-efficient tensor management

### ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What are the minimum system requirements?**
A: Any modern browser with ES6 support and a webcam. For optimal experience, a device with at least 4GB RAM is recommended.

**Q: Is internet connection required after initial load?**
A: Only for the first load to download PoseNet models. After that, the application works completely offline.

**Q: Can I use this with a pre-recorded video?**
A: Currently, only live webcam input is supported, but video file support is planned for a future release.

**Q: How accurate is the calorie estimation?**
A: Our estimates are based on standard MET values and should be considered approximations rather than medical-grade measurements.

**Q: Can I add custom exercises?**
A: Currently, exercise algorithms are hardcoded, but we're developing a framework for user-defined exercises.
