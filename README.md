✨ Overview
PoseNet Fitness Tracker is a browser-based application that uses machine learning to analyze your exercise form in real-time. By leveraging Google's PoseNet model through ml5.js, it detects 17 body keypoints and provides instant feedback on your workout technique, counts repetitions, and estimates calories burned.
